                        Each of these pages has been designed to serve you with a specific subset of data. Some of these pages allow you to comb through its 
                        contents using emotion "flairs". When a flair is activated, all articles or resources that pertain to that flair will appear.

                        that you would like to see. Although a lot of the pages are automated and update themselves, the articles and resources that have an emotion

                        â€œCOVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-Co-V-2. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now this new virus, names SARS-CoV-2. 
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. 
                        Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Most international destinations now have ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as does the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and 
                        it is not known how or where they became exposed."

                        A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.
