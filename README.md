# Covid Central 

> Covid Central is an effort by a group of interns at the Florida State University's Innovation Hub. Our goal is to provide users a centralized dashboard filled with reliable information regarding the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.

## The Frameworks

For this project we will be using the following frameworks and libraries.
1. ReactJS 
> ReactJS allows for the quick implementaion of dynamically rendered web applications using the fundamentals of JavaScript and a rich library of NPM packages.
2. Flask
> Flask allows for the quick implementation of a backend server that will host some of our desired endpoints.

## The Mechanics

The schema of Covid Central is simple.
