# Covid Central 

> Covid Central is an effort by a group of interns at the Florida State University's Innovation Hub. Our goal is to provide users a centralized dashboard filled with reliable information regarding the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.

## The Frameworks

For this project we will be using the following frameworks and libraries.
1. ReactJS 
> ReactJS allows for the quick implementaion of dynamically rendered web applications using the fundamentals of JavaScript and a rich library of NPM packages.
2. Flask
> Flask allows for the quick implementation of a backend server that will host some of our desired endpoints.

## The Mechanics

The schema of Covid Central is simple.

**Form**

On the launch page there is a form with the following categories.

##### **I'm Feeling**

*There will be a list of feelings listed here [TBD]. For example, sad, curious, or anxious.*

##### **Show Me**

*There will be a list of content listed here [TBD]. For example, the facts, stats, news, or commentary.*


**Results**

The form will redirect the user to the next page depending on their input.

For example, if a user says they're feeling **anxious** and they want to be shown **the stats** then we will show them the number of recovered patients primarily. 

At the bottom of the user's tailored results there will be a reset button that will take them back to the launch page. 

## The Data

The bulk of the data and articles in Covid Central come from the Covid Tracking Project API.

> "The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. We attempt to include positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data." https://covidtracking.com/

We are also compiling a list of more resources and APIs that will be used to present data.

1. Twitter API [for commentary] 

2. CNN API [for news]

## The Team

As previously mentioned, this is an effort created by a group of interns at Florida State University's Innovation Hub. The Hub's mission statement is quoted below:
> "To foster a collaborative community founded on a culture of creativity and innovation that identifies issues, explores opportunities, and develops solutions using design thinking and emerging technologies." https://innovation.fsu.edu/
