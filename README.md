# Covid Central 

> Covid Central is an effort by a group of interns at the Florida State University's Innovation Hub. Our goal is to provide users a centralized dashboard filled with reliable information regarding the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.

## The Frameworks

For this project we will be using the following frameworks and libraries.
1. ReactJS 
> ReactJS allows for the quick implementaion of dynamically rendered web applications using the fundamentals of JavaScript and a rich library of NPM packages.
2. Flask
> Flask allows for the quick implementation of a backend server that will host some of our desired endpoints.

## The Mechanics

The schema of Covid Central is simple.

**Form**

On the launch page there is a form with the following categories.

I'm Feeling

*There will be a list of feelings listed here [TBD]. For example, sad, curious, or anxious*

Show Me

*There will be a list of content listed here [TBD]. For example, the facts, stats, news, or commentary*


**Form Results** 

The form will redirect the user to the next page depending on their input.

For example, if a user says they're feeling sad and they want to be shown the facts then we will tailor their page so they can primarily see the number of recovered patients. 

At the bottom of the users tailored results there will be a reset button that will take the user back to the launch page. 

## The Data

The bulk of the data and articles in Covid Central come from the Covid Tracking Project API.

> "The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. We attempt to include positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data." https://covidtracking.com/

We are also compiling a list of more resources and APIs that will be used to present data.

1. Twitter API [for commentary] 

2. CNN API [for news]
